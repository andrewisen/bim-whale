## Introduction

This site is built using [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org).
This page is automatically generated from the TypeScript source code.

## Why TypeScript?

I prefer TS for one simple reason:

> Developer tooling support / Enhanced IDE support

In my option, TS makes it much easier to work with IFC.

## Where should I start?

Start by looking at the [stepFile Class](https://github.bimvalen.se/docs/classes/stepfile.html).
This is the base. In fact, this class has nothing to do with IFC.

The "method" [\_generateStepInstance](https://github.bimvalen.se/docs/globals.html#_generatestepinstance) is used to build a so called STEP Instance.

Take a good look at this Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21).

That article explains the very basics...

## But, I don't understand

No worries. The goal with the BIM Whale is to teach people how to work with IFC.
However, the learning resources are not ready yet. Have some patience!
